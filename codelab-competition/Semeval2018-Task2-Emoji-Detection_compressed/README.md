We will use the English part of the data from a recent research competition, SemEval 2018 Task 2 on
Multilingual emoji prediction: https://competitions.codalab.org/competitions/17344. You can
download the dataset with already crawled English tweets, to be used in this assignment, here:
https://www.dropbox.com/s/ihgw2mbsemsmwfk/Semeval2018-Task2-Emoji-Detection_compressed.zi
p?dl=0 . The dataset is prepared in a way such that it is split into a “training” and “trial” part. Tweets
and the corresponding emojis the tweets

Some ideas from this example:

But for now I don't know why the score is much lower for my case, comparing with
the example code above. Perhaps we were looking at different data?
